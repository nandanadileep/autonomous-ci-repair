# autonomous-ci-repair

An autonomous CI agent that diagnoses failing builds, identifies the root cause from logs,
generates code fixes using multi-model reasoning, verifies the fix, and commits it back automatically.

## Why This Exists

CI failures break developer flow. This agent acts as a junior DevOps engineer that never sleeps.

## Core Ideas

- Multi-model reasoning (log analysis vs code repair)
- Explicit agent loop (no agent frameworks)
- Deterministic tool execution
- Verification before commit
- Zero-cost production stack

## Architecture

(coming soon)

## Status

🚧 In active development
